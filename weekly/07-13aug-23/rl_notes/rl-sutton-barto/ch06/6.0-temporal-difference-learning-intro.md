# Temporal Difference Learning - Bölüm 6

Temporal difference learning is a combination of MC ideas and DP ideas.

Like MC methods they can learn directly from experience, without a model of the environment’s dynamics.

Like DP, TD methods update estimates based in part on other learned estimates, without waiting for final outcomes. (they bootstrap)

TD, DP and MC methods blend into each other and can be combined in many ways. In Chapter07 you’ll see **n-step algorithms**.
